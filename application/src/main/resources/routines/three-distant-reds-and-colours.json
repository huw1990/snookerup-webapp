    "This routine practises a common scenario seen in frames. It's been nip and tuck, then all of a sudden you get an opportunity where, with a few reds remaining, they're all pottable, but far apart on the table.",
    "For the setup of this routine, place one red directly between pink and black, another directly between blue and pink, and one more directly between brown and blue. Start by placing the white wherever you want, then pot all three reds with colours and clear the table.",
    "The key to this routine is picking the best route through the table, then achieving good judgement of pace to get good position each time."
